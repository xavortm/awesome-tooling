# Awesome Tooling
All tools, apps, extensions, plugins and related that I use for everything.

### AI Tools
 - [Aider](https://aider.chat/) - An amazing companion for AI help in the terminal. Works directly with git repositories and has many neat functions.
 - [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) - AI terminal app to work with your codebase. I find the results moderately good and productive.

### PDFs
 - [PDFGear](https://www.pdfgear.com/share/) - FREE app for working with PDFs on Mac. For me, this works better than the heavy and paid Adobe.
