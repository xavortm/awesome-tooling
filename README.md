# Awesome Tooling
All tools, apps, extensions, plugins and related that I use for everything.

### Code Editors
 - [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - My editor of choice - fast, reliable and just a joy to work with.
 - [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/ - Testing out for AI features, while it requires a ton of mouse work, it's not like it's bad, just a little annoying. And a laggy on M1 macbook compared to Neovim. But I do enjoy the flow sometimes (tested paid version).

### AI Tools
 - [Aider](https://aider.chat/) - An amazing companion for AI help in the terminal. Works directly with git repositories and has many neat functions.
 - [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) - AI terminal app to work with your codebase. I find the results moderately good and productive.

### Terminals
 - [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) - My choice for a terminal - GPU based, fast, works 100% of the time, performant, great config options. Supports background images, not like alacritty.

### PDFs
 - [PDFGear](https://www.pdfgear.com/share/) - FREE app for working with PDFs on Mac. For me, this works better than the heavy and paid Adobe.

### Note taking
 - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - For just taking notes, better than notion as you can host it yourself and own the files.
 - [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) - A pretty UI with nice quality of life features but lack of local files is a big downside.

### Other apps and tools
 - [LocalWP](https://localwp.com/) - For local WordPress development
 - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/) - Chrome + Chrome Dev for work because I found it's dev tools to fit my needs best.
